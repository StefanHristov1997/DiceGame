### Game description
First of all, your goal is to beat the computer in this game. <img align = "right" src = "https://github.com/StefanHristov1997/Simple_Dice_Game/assets/133797718/d3bc529c-2cfb-434c-9d7f-1f9e5c292d9a" width= "200" higth="300" /></br>
You have to select a number between 1-6 and press "ENTER" to start the game. </br>
The game is set up to have 3 dice and 5 rounds, so if the number you pick equals one of the numbers on the dice, your points increase. </br>
After your 5 rounds it's time for the computer to play and it also picks a random number and repeats the steps. </br>
Finally, the game compares the results and prints the winner. </br>
